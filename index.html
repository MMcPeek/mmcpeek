		<h3>Internship Mock-Up</h3>
		<p>In 2018, I designed this mock-up website for an intership that I had applied for. I ultimately chose to accept my current job over this internship, but this website helped me gain a deeper understanding for design and forms.</p>

		<h1>Skills</h1>
		<p>I have experience coding in Java, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Visual Basic, and Javascript. I have the most experience in Java, HTML, and CSS. I've taken a few different classes where I learned HTML and CSS, and I've also coded websites on my own in these languages. I've taken one course each that taught Java, Python, Visual Basic, and SQL. I am currently teaching myself Javascript, and I'm in a course right now that teaches C+ along with coding mobile applications.</p><br>
		<p>Along with programming languages, I also have computer technology skills from a lifetime of troubleshooting mine and my family's problems. In 2017, I had an internship where I worked at a school district in their IT department.</p>

		<div id="about">
		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm 20 years old, from Ohio, and have been married for two years. Outside of coding and school, I enjoy spending time with my husband, dog, and my friends. I also enjoy going to the gym, running, reading, and travelling. I will graduate in May 2020 with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, and I'm hoping to attend Georgia Tech the following semester to get my Master's Degree in Computer Science.</p>
