		<br><br><p>I have the most experience in HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, and MySQL. I've coded websites and applications on my own and for other businesses in these languages. I've also taken courses that taught all of the above listed languages. In addition to these courses, I've also coded projects on my own to gain additional experience. Finally, I worked at Pioneer-360 where I got to create web applications for other businesses.</p><br>
			
		<p>Along with programming languages, I also have computer technology skills from a lifetime of troubleshooting mine and my family's problems. In 2017, I had an internship where I worked at a school district in their IT department. Additionaly, I have experience and skill in photo and video editing. I can also create websites using any template website, such as WordPress.</p>
